- member variables overriden are instance methods, instance variable , static method and static variable
  however only instance method is polymorphically overriden
  instance variable can be shadowned by recreating same variable in child
  static method might look like overriden in child but thats a new method
  static variable also is nothing but a new in child
 in all 3 above case the reference variable type define the method/variable at compile time
