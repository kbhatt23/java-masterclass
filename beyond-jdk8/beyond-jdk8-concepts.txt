- Java completed 25th birthday in 2020 and still java is very very rock solid, reliable and stable
- Even Code written in jdk 1 can be executed using jdk 17 without recompiling
  eg: take .class compiled using jdk1 and run using jdk 17 it still works same with jar
      created jar using jdk1 but running java -jar using jdk 17
  This is one of the main reason for java's enterprise/production success
  Version of java can be upgraded/downgraded without much hassle : backward and forward compatibility

- During Relase of jdk8's era new version used to come after years like 2-3 years and even more
  but now a new release cycle is used of 6 months now

- Java new Version evolution happens to add new features as well as enhance performance, space,security and ease of usage

- Earlier java had feature driven release cycle causing huge time for next version release
  but after release of jdk 10 release cycle is based on time
  ths will ensure no postponing of releases like jdk 10 due to huge feature modules
  eg 3 features were planned but 2 were complete and hence these 2 will release and 3rd feature can wait for next cycle
  adds rapid inovation + no postponing of release
- now we have 2 releases per year : march and september
- now the versioning of each jdk version contains release date along with jdk release version 

- each release can be long term supported or non long term supported
  plan is to have LTS release after every 3 years
  LTS means java will support this enterprise version until a new LTS is launched
  so we can have version migratio every 3 yearsor n years which is planned for next LTS release

- Starting from jdk 11 Oracle JDK is paid to be used in production but free for local development and playground  
- Oracle also provides openjdk which is free even in production
  there is another open source community version aka adoptopenjdk this is also free in production
  other providers are amazon correto, azul zulu, ibm, redhat,sap etc`
- after jdk 17 release in septmeber 2021 LTS support release cycle is moved to 2 years instead of 3 years
  also there is  new licence introduced using which we can use versions >=jdk 17  free even in production
  but subject to conditions mentioned in the license. Open jdk remain free with 6 months support as usual
