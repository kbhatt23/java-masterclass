- A Viewed Collection is just a view for underlying data structure
- General rule of any viewed collection is that modifying it also modify the underlying D.S
	, also new item can not be added in viewd collection , however removal and modification of current items can be done
	, also any cahnge in underlying sructure will also show up in viewed collection
- examples:
	a. Arrays.as List:
	-> It creates a arraylist view that links to a fixed size array
	-> we can not grow the size of that array and hence can not add any item to list
	-> however we can still modify the list and that will show up in array as well
	
	b. Map.keyset
		-> any modification in key et can be done like remove or update and it will reflectin Map(underlying d.s)
		-> but can not add a new entry -> unsuportedoperationexception
		
- A treeset/treemap -> uses comparator to insert items in specific order
- a rare case is that the tree set and treemap uses comparator comare method to check if two items are equal or not
	-> eample if we add treset.add("ONE")l then treset.add("one") and if the comparator used was Case insensitive string then it consider both items to be equals in treeset
		but in hashet it uses equals method
- Sorting gives preference for CAPS up chars before caps down, eg treeset.add("AA"), treeset.add("ZZ") treese.add("aa")
	-> it will have 		AA,ZZ,aa
